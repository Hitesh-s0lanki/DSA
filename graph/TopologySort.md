Here’s a real-life use case of **Topological Sort** in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA):

### ✅ **Use Case: Task Scheduling in Project Management**

#### 🎯 **Scenario:**

Imagine you're managing a complex project — like building a house, launching a product, or planning a software release — where **some tasks must be completed before others can begin**.

#### 🏗️ **Example:**

Consider these tasks for building a house:

1. Lay the foundation
2. Build the walls (after the foundation)
3. Install the roof (after walls)
4. Paint the walls (after walls)
5. Install plumbing and electrical (after foundation)
6. Install appliances (after plumbing and electrical)

Here, the dependencies form a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** — meaning:

- No task depends on itself directly or indirectly
- Tasks have a directed order

#### 🧠 **Why Topological Sort?**

- It gives an **ordering of tasks** that respects all dependencies.
- Helps to **schedule tasks** in the correct sequence to avoid logical errors or delays.

### 💻 **Other Real-World Examples:**

1. **Build Systems (e.g., Make, Gradle)** – Compile source files in dependency order.
2. **Course Prerequisites** – Planning which courses to take in which semester.
3. **Dependency Resolution in Package Managers** – Installing packages in the correct order.
4. **Data Pipeline Processing** – Running ETL jobs that depend on output from previous jobs.
